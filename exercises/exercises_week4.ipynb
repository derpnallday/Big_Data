    "Machine learning is a technique for learning patterns in data that enable computers to make decisions and predictions. It's probably one of the hottest skills to master as a scientist or engineer in research or industry today. This week, we'll get an overview of what machine learning is, what it can be used for and what its limits are. Without worrying too much about what goes on behind the scenes, we will play around with a few classifiers in Python and test model performance using cross validation. The exercises today cover:\n",
